# bouncing-robots
SOFTENG 251 Assignment 3 - 2018

Class files created in Java that represent bouncing 'robots' - objects that bounce within a frame using Swing. This is the very first assignment and experience of coding in Java.

Base code is created by Craig Sutherland. Class files that I created include most subclasses of Robot.
