# bouncing-robots
SOFTENG 251 Assignment 3 - 2018

Class files created in Java that represent bouncing 'robots' - objects that bounce within a frame using Swing. This is the second assignment written in Java split into 3 parts. 

*DISCLAIMER* Not all code is written by me:
Base code is created by Craig Sutherland. Class files that I created include most subclasses of Robot.
